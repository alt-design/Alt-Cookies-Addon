## Advanced Use

To build a custom cookie popup:

- Open up your master `Template.antlers.html` or equivalent
- Add our `{{ AltCookies:Scripts }}` tag to your popup view.
- You'll need an "Accept" and "Accept Necessary" button.
- The "Accept" button needs to have `{{ AltCookies:accept }}` in it's onclick
- The "Accept Necessary" button needs to have `{{ AltCookies:decline }}` in it's onclick
- You will then need at least 2 checkboxes to configure analytics and advertising cookies.
- The Analytics checkbox requires an id of `alt-cookies-analytics` for the Javascript to hook into
- The Analytics checkbox requires an id of `alt-cookies-advertising` for the Javascript to hook into
- If you just want to allow `Necessary` and `All` cookies as your options, then you could hide these checkboxes and give them the `checked` property. They just need to exist.
